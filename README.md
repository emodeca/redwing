# redwing

A firey Hollow Knight mod supporting lifeblood.

### Features

This mod is a fully open source Hollow Knight mod, designed primarilly as an addon for Blackmoth, that adds cool fireballs to your dash attacks!

It is built for lifeblood.

#### Why use this mod

After all, isn't blackmoth good enough on it's own? Well it does add several new effects:

* Updashing throws fireballs everywhere!
* All other directional dashes leave a fire trail behind you which hurts enemies over time.
* Focusing causes fire spikes to form and damage nearby enemies.
* Getting hit causes a large fire pillar to appear where you were, damaging nearby enemies.

#### Other features

* All damage and power values fully customizable.
* Procedurally generated images- Enjoy unique fire every time you load the game. A mod file smaller than one fireball can generate millions of them.


### How to install

This mod depends on:

[ModCommon](https://github.com/Kerr1291/ModCommon) by Kerr1291

[Modding API](https://github.com/seanpr96/HollowKnight.Modding) by Wyza, Firzen, and Seanpr

It is also super important/highly recommended you install this with:

[Blackmoth](https://github.com/Ayugradow/Blackmoth) by Gradow

So first install these from either github or the google drive.

Then download or compile the redwing dll from the "releases" section.

You may optionally install this mod alongside [Grimmchild Upgrades](https://github.com/natis1/grimmchildupgrades). There's no integrations but the two together alongside blackmoth will make you effectively a god.
