# redwing

This is a fork of AvengingAngle's redwing. The intent is to fix some bugs introduced with the GodMaster DLC and possibly pick up with the WIP Rebalance that AA started.

### Features

* Become a God, with 8 new fiery effects which augment your attacks and dashes, and help you when you get hit.
* A "hard" mode which forces you to use these flames as your primary weapon.
* 14 unique assets, all generated procedurally by the most advanced engine in any Hollow Knight mod. Enjoy unique fire every time you load the game.
* All damage and power values fully configurable. With Redwing, you get the final say on balance.
* Can function as an addon for Blackmoth, explicitly built to maximize compatibility and balance between the two.

It is also highly recommended you install this with:

You should probably install these from the [google drive, linked here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_b9PFqx_PR9Um9MeFZMV21oWGs), or, if you know what you're doing, you can compile them from source code.
