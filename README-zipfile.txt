# redwing

A massive fiery Hollow Knight mod! Redwing provides your character with numerous radiant, flaming abilities which give you more damage and make you stronger. It's fully configurable, and even includes a hard mode, if you're up for the challenge. Its designed to work with other total overhaul mods, including Lightbringer and Blackmoth.

### Features

* Become a God, with 8 new fiery effects which augment your attacks and dashes, and help you when you get hit.
* A "hard" mode which forces you to use these flames as your primary weapon.
* 14 unique assets, all generated procedurally by the most advanced engine in any Hollow Knight mod. Enjoy unique fire every time you load the game.
* All damage and power values fully configurable. With Redwing, you get the final say on balance.
* Can function as an addon for Blackmoth, explicitly built to maximize compatibility and balance between the two.
